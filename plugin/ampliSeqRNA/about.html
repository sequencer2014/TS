<p>
This plugin generates statistics, downloadable data files and interactive visualization of representation of
targeted RNA transcripts.
</p>
<p>
This plugin should be used with runs aligned to the hg19_AmpliSeq_Transcriptome_ERCC_v1 reference (or subsequent version)
and a suitable targets panel, e.g. hg19_AmpliSeq_Transcriptome_21K_v1. Comparative representation plots across barcodes are created in addition to individual reports for each barcode.
