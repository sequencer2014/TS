	<p>
            This plugin generates statistics, downloadable data files and interactive visualization of representation of
            immune response RNA transcripts.</p>
        <p>
            This plugin should be used with runs aligned to the hg19_rna_ImmuneResponsePanelv2 reference (or subsequent
            version) and immune response targets panel.
        <p>
            The Filter Barcodes option may be checked to indicate to remove whole barcodes
            from the subsequent analysis if they have relatively low number of reads, e.g. as might result from barcode
            contamination.
            A warning will be issued to the barcode summary report if any barcodes were discounted from the analysis.
            This option is ignored for runs not employing barcodes.</p>
        <p>
            The ERCC Tracking option is recommended if your targets (amplicons) were 'spiked' with ERCC tracking
            targets. This will inform the analysis to produce an extra statistic for reads mapped to these targets so
            that
            the true level of 'off-target' reads is accurately represented. Your reference does not have to include ERCC
            references for
            this to work but whether such reads are included with the fraction of reads considered 'on-target' will
            depend on this.</p>
