<title>sampleID Plugin</title>

<p>
This plugin produces a 'unique' identication code ('sample ID') composed of the identified human sample gender
and series of IUPAC base letters, based on calling a series of target alleles verses the genome. Typically this
plugin is run on barcoded libraries such that an unambiguous sample ID is reported for each barcode.
For this to work, the AmpliSeq library must have been prepared with AmpliSeq sample tracking amplicons.
The detailed report pages provides the complete information on tracking reads and allele counts.
This plugin is only applicable to runs with reads aligned to the human hg19 or GRCh38 reference.
